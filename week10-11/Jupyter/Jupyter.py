# Explain jupyter: main features and benefits.

# Jupyter Notebook is open source client-based web application which you can use to create and share documents
#that contain code, visualizations and text.

# Jupyter supports over 100 programming languages.

# Benefits of Jupyter is that you can share projects with exported .html or .pdf files easily
# People can see results and output of the code without understanding programming 
# (You can example use matplotlib to show charts and other visualisations) 
# Jupyter was made for data science but it could be handy in studying too.

# In Jupyter you make code in separate cells so you can try specific cell of the code without executing whole code.
